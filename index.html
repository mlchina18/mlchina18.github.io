              <p align="justify" class="style9">During the past decade, machine learning researches in China have been growing in a blooming way. This is witnessed by the increasing number of works appeared in major machine learning related conferences and journals, and also numerous successful applications of machine learning techniques in major Chinese high-tech companies such as 
				Huawei, Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba,  etc. There are also many domestic machine learning conferences regularly held in China which attract a significant number of participants, such as the biennial Chinese Conference on Machine Learning, the annual Chinese Workshop on Machine Learning and Applications, the annual Chinese Vision and Learning Seminar, etc.<br/><br/>
              To take full advantage of the opportunity that <a href="http://www.acml-conf.org/2018/" target="_blank">ACML is to be held in Beijing</a>, a dedicated full-day workshop for machine learning researchers and practitioners in China is organized. This workshop would be a great chance for sharing ideas and expertise among interested participants, encouraging students and junior researchers to get suggestions and advices from senior experts, and also fostering connections and possible collaborations between Chinese and International machine learning communities.</p>

                 Speaker: Tie-Yan Liu, Microsoft Research Asia<br/>
  <br/>
                 Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNN) have demonstrated outstanding performances in many real applications, such as speech recognition, image classification, and natural language processing. However, it seems that the theoretical understanding of DNN is far behind its practical success. In this talk, I will first give a review of the existing theoretical studies on DNN, mainly from the perspectives of generalization ability and approximation ability. Then, I will introduce our recent research on this topic. Specifically, we start with the margin bound - the expected test error of a model can be upper bounded by its empirical margin error plus a Rademacher Average (RA) based capacity term. On this basis, we derive an upper bound for the RA of DNN (which increases with the increasing depth of the network structure), and show that deeper networks tend to generate smaller margin error on the given training data due to larger representation power (measured by Betti numbers based
  > complexity). These findings indicate that for DNN with restricted total number of parameters, arbitrarily increasing the depth is not always good since there is a clear tradeoff between its positive and negative impacts on the test error. These findings also inspire us to look for alternative ways to achieve the positive impact of depth, e.g., by directly imposing a margin-based penalty terms to the loss function so as to purposely reduce empirical margin error without increasing depth. Our experimental results show that in this alternative way, we can achieve significantly better test performances on several datasets. <br/>

                 Speaker: Jun Zhu, Tsinghua University, China<br/>
  <br/>
                 Abstract: Bayesian methods represent one important school of statistical methods for learning, inference and decision making. At the core is Bayes' theorem, which has been developed for more than 250 years. However, in the Big Data era, many challenges need to be addressed, ranging from theory, algorithm, and applications. In this talk, I will introduce some recent developments on generalizing Bayes' theorem to incorporate rich side information, which can be the large-margin property we like to impose on the model distribution, or the domain knowledge collected from experts or the crowds, and scalable online learning and distributed inference algorithms. The generic framework to do such tasks is called regularized Bayesian inference (RegBayes). Our O(1) Gibbs sampler can learn topic models with trillion parameters on TB datasets.<br/>

                 Speaker: Yu Zhang, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology<br/>
  <br/>
                 Abstract: Multi-task learning aims to improve the generalization performance of multiple learning tasks by leveraging useful information among them. One core issue in multi-task learning is to identify the relations among tasks before using them to help the learning process and many methods have been proposed to learn different forms of task relations. In this talk, I will introduce a framework called multi-level multi-task learning, which decomposes the model parameters of all the tasks into multiple levels, to model complex task relations. Then two concrete learning algorithms under the framework will be discussed. The first algorithm, the multi-level task grouping method, learns different task groups in each level. Different from the first algorithm which assumes that different levels are independent, the second algorithm aims to learn tree structure among tasks by adding constraints among levels. Experiments on benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.<br/>

                 Speaker: Ming-Lin Zhang, Southeast University, China<br/>
  <br/>
                 Abstract: Binary relevance (BR) is arguably the most popular approach towards multi-label learning, which decomposes the multi-label learning problem into a number of independent binary classificaiton problems, one per category. In view of the well-known weakness of BR, i.e. ignorance of label correlations, a number of enhanced versions of BR have been developed in recent years by endowing BR with the ability of label correlations exploitation. Nonetheless, in addition to label correlations exploitation, there are several factors which need to be considered to make BR-based approach work effectively. In this talk, I will introduce some of our recent progresses on BR-based multi-label learning. <br/>

                 Speaker: Wei-Shi Zheng, Sun Yat-Sen University, China<br/>
  <br/>
                 Abstract: Matching people across nonoverlapping camera views at different locations and different times, known as person reidentification, is both a hard and important problem for associating behavior of people observed in a large distributed space over a prolonged period of time. Person reidentification is fundamentally challenging because of the large visual appearance changes caused by variations in view angle, gesture, lighting, background clutter, and occlusion. Due to these challenges, it is hard to extract distinctive and reliable visual features across camera views. Hence, seeking an optimal and robust similarity measure that quantifies a wide range of features against realistic viewing conditions is critically important for person reidentification. This talk will present our recent research works on distance learning for robust cross-view matching, including relative distance comparison model and its transfer extension for solving the open-world matching problem, an asymmetric view-transform distance model, a cross-scale subspace model, and a cross-scenario transfer model. <br/>
